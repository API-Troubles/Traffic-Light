# Traffic Light
A semi-realistic traffic light created in TinkerCAD with Arduinos and micro:bits


Created by Felix G for the Arcade hackathon. Work in progress.

The link & some photos will be released when I'm finished. Source code for the Arduino and micro:bits go here.

## Note for the reviewers at Arcade!
TinkerCAD provides a virtual code editor and simulator, for which there is no git function. I have uploaded screenshots and videos in my sessions as scraps instead. I'll also be uploading by updated code as I go.
